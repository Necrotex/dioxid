##Flexible PHP5.3 MVC Framework

Dioxid is a PHP 5.3 MVC Framework, inspired by Tom Frosts
"Hydrogen" and the Zend Framework, licensed unter
The MIT License.

I've written it becourse I needed a very flexible and
powerful but yet small MVC Framework with very few restrictions.

I didn't like all the conventions I'd had to face with the
Zend Framework. Also with a growing project the internal held
objects getting real big, even if I don't need them.

So here it is: Dioxid. At the moment it works pretty well, with 
very few know bugs. Through this framework is still young there may be
more, yet not know, urgent or harmless bugs. So if you discover one, 
drop me a line or send me a patch ;) 

Unfortunatly there is a lack of documentation at the moment. The most
importent files have some PHPDOc style comments with usage examples in
them. As soon as I get around to implement the last few things for
version 1.0, I'll write a complete How to use guide with tutorials and
a improve the PHPDoc.

##How to use
Copy the index.php and config.ini files from the examples folder into your
project diretory and edit them to your needs.

Dioxid is a modeled after the Frontcontrollerdesignpattern, so you need
to tell your Webserver to redirect all request to the index.php. There
is also an example file for nginx in the examples folder.

Now your ready to start working on your first controller.

A more detailed documentation is at the moment under constrution and 
should be soon availbe.

For a more detailed look into Dioxid inner workings or adanved usage
take a look at the doc folder for a PHPDoc overview.

##Last but not least
If your having any querstions, drop me a line ;)
